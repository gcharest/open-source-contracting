# Guidance covering contributing back to open source

A checklist of items and guides for contributing back.
- Individuals working on open source projects, should have accounts so that they can create issues & provide feedback.
- Organizations using open source project should have an organizational account if they can.
- Participating in events (local or global) tied to open source software is a good way to learn more about it and ensure that there is a robust community.
- Make sure it is clear that you want to hire organizations who contribute back to the open source tools you depend on.
- If there is a crowd-funding appeal for the open source tools that you use, find a way to contribute.
- Talk about the open source tools that you use and spread the word about how they help you.
- If there is an association supporting the open source tools you use, join it. The membership fee is usually trivial. It helps.
- Make sure staff know how to [attribute their contributions and there is a clear policy for this](https://disic.github.io/politique-de-contribution-open-source/en/ouverture/#contribution-policy-assistance)
- Look for a [Get Involved](https://www.drupal.org/project/content/issues/1414988) page on the community's site where they describe what they are looking for.  Maybe you can help. Often these projects need more than just developers.
